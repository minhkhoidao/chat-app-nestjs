A brief description of what this project does and who it's for.

## Description

This project is a backend application built with NestJS, utilizing GraphQL for data querying and mutations, Redis for caching, and Prisma as the ORM for database management. It aims to provide a robust and efficient API for a scalable web application.

## Features

- **GraphQL API**: Leverage GraphQL for efficient data fetching and mutations.
- **Redis Caching**: Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
- **Prisma ORM**: Use Prisma for easy database management and access.
- **Authentication**: Secure the application using JWT-based authentication.
- **Real-time Data**: Utilize GraphQL subscriptions for real-time data updates.
